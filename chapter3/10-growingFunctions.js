// We could find ourselves writing very similar code multiple times.
// We want to avoid doing that since having more code means more space for mistakes
// to hide and more material to read for people trying to understand the program.
// So we take the repetead functionality, find a good name for it, and put it into
// a function.

// You might even start writing code that uses the function before you actually
// define the function itself.

// How difficult it is to find a good name for a function is a good indication of
// how clear a concept it is that you're trying to wrap.

// How start and versatile should our function be? A useful principle is not to add
// cleverness unless you are absolutely sure you're going to need it.
